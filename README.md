# Algorithms and Data Structures
This GitHub repository is a comprehensive collection of solutions to programming problems sourced from online 
platforms **(LeetCode, Szkopul, Codeforces)**. The solutions are meticulously sorted based on the problem names and 
categorized by programming language extensions for easy access. 

## Solution Form 
Each problem solution is formatted as ***problem-name.language-extension***, allowing users to quickly identify and 
implement solutions in their preferred programming language. The repository offers a diverse range of algorithms, 
data structures, and coding challenges, making it a valuable resource for programmers seeking reference 
implementations or assistance in tackling similar problems.

## Request
While the repository provides convenient solutions, it's crucial for users to approach these resources ethically, 
ensuring that they use them responsibly for learning and understanding rather than solely for direct submission 
in academic or competitive settings.
